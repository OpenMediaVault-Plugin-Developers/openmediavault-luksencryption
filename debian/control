Description:  OpenMediaVault LUKS encryption plugin
 LUKS is the standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing a
 standard on-disk-format, it not only facilitates compatibility
 among distributions, but also provides secure management of multiple
 user passwords. In contrast to existing solutions, LUKS stores all
 necessary setup information in the partition header, enabling the
 user to transport or migrate his data seamlessly.
